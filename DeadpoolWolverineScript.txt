FADE UP ON:
THE MARVEL LOGO.
DEADPOOL (V.O.)
That logo music just gets you 
pumped, right? Oh sorry, I’m just-- *
I’m excited to be here. It’s been a *
while.
1 EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - WILDERNESS - DAY 1
Somewhere, more like NOWHERE...
But let’s be honest, we all know where. As darkness lifts... 
The iconic notes from “ONLY YOU” by The Platters are all 
around us as images slowly come into view...
Grey clouds fill the sky. Lazy snowflakes flutter down onto a 
light dusting of fresh snow covering the landscape. 
We track low. Following familiar (but different) black and 
red boots as they crush earth below. The hilt of familiar 
(but different) swords glint in the winter light. This lone 
red-suited figure is on a mission. The montage of tight 
vignettes continue as a familiar voice welcomes us:
DEADPOOL (V.O.)
You, know for a long time I wasn’t 
sure I’d ever be back. Disney 
bought Fox. There was a whole 
boring rights issue, blahbityblahbity-blah. But then it turned 
out they wanted me. The one guy who 
shouldn’t even have his own movie, 
much less a franchise. Marvel’s so 
stupid. Look, we all saw the 
trailer. We know the title of this 
thing, so I know what you’re 
wondering. How are we going to do 
this without dishonoring Logan’s 
memory? And I’ll tell you how...
2 EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - GRAVESITE - DAY 2
CLOSE ON: A familiar makeshift wooden CRUCIFIX, turned fortyfive degrees to form an ‘X.’
DEADPOOL (V.O.)
...We’re not.
The camera slowly drifts back from the iconic ‘X’, widening 
to reveal an “I LIKE ME” MUG perched atop a rock. 
(CONTINUED)
2 (CONTINUED) 2
2ND BLUE REV. (04/17/24) 2.
Wider still now, we see chunks of dirt being flung up and out
of a hole in the ground, never seeing the source of the
earthen projectiles, just the metronomic sound of spade
impaling earth.
DEADPOOL (V.O.)
I’m going to let you in on a little
secret. Wolverine is not dead.
Sure, it made for a perfect ending
to a very sad story. But that’s not
how regenerative healing factors
work. You think I want to be out
here in Butt-Fuck North Dakota
digging up the one and only
Wolverine? No thank you. But the
fate of my entire world is at
stake. He may not be living his
best life, but he sure as hell
ain’t dead.
SHUNK.
The sound STOPS as contact is made. Contact with...something.
DEADPOOL (O.C.)
Well, there you are. Yes, yes, yes,
yes.
The grave-robber stands upright for the first time,
revealing:
DEADPOOL
Standing waist deep in a hole of his making. His suit is new.
Bespoke. He pokes around with the tip of his beat-up old
shovel, confirming something is under there. He vanishes down
into the hole again, furiously clearing the last layer of
earth. Fistfuls of dirt and roots go flying.
Below the frame, the sound of Deadpool’s digging stops as we
sense he’s found what he came looking for and it’s...
disappointing.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Come on. Son of a bitch. AGHH
MOTHER-FUCKER-- MY WORLD IS FUCKED.
Deadpool throws a mini-tantrum, punching the air, knocking
over the pile of dirt. Smashing the ‘X’ with a home-run swing
of his shovel. Breaking the shovel across his thigh and
tossing the parts into the hole, only to have the metallic
shovel-tip come bouncing right up and out back at him.
Finally exhausted, Deadpool stands upright, spins, and falls
backwards right into the hole and out of sight.

4 EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - LOG NEAR GRAVESITE - DAY 4
We see Deadpool sitting. Talking. As we continue to drift 
slowly past, we reveal Logan sitting beside him. They are 
sitting against the very same tree where Logan died in LOGAN.
DEADPOOL *
That was weird. I’m much calmer *
now. Look, I’m not a man of *
science, but you seem incredibly 
passed away. 
(sighs)
But it’s good to see ya.
The adamantium skeleton is seated in a casual pose. Legs 
folded elegantly like Cary Grant at a dinner party. If Logan 
wasn’t completely decayed and held together by A FEW rotting 
tendons, it would look like two dudes hanging out in the 
woods. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
I’ve gotta be honest. I’ve always 
wanted to ride with you, Log’. You 
and me, getting into it. Deadpool 
and Wolverine just fucking shit up. 
Can you imagine the fun? The chaos? 
The residuals? 
(in Australian accent)
G’day mate. There’s nothing that’ll 
bring me back to life faster than a 
big bag of Marvel cash. 
(without accent)
Me too, Hugh. But no. No, no, no.
You had to get all noble and die 
for real. Goddamnit, I could really 
use your help right now--
The words are no sooner out of Deadpool’s mouth than the air 
nearby begins to glow and shimmer.
WIDE ANGLE. 
A TIME DOOR APPEARS AND OPENS.
Out floods an army of MASKED MINUTEMEN from the TIME VARIANCE 
AUTHORITY (TVA). Upgraded since we last saw them in ‘Loki.’ 
FULLY ARMORED and WIELDING TIMESTICKS. Ready for action.
The Minutemen take an aggressive posture. We see Deadpool pop 
his head out like a gopher from behind the hill. He 
disappears down below and yells from behind the knoll:

DEADPOOL (O.C.) (CONT’D)
WAIT! I’m warning you! I’m not
alone.
UNMASKED MINUTEMAN
Wade Winston Wilson! You are under
arrest by the Time Variance
Authority for too many crimes to
list. Come out and we’ll give you
the courtesy of taking you in one
piece.
DEADPOOL
Ughhhh, death by day-player.
UNMASKED MINUTEMAN
Last chance: Throw out your weapons
and come out peacefully.
DEADPOOL
(calling to Minutemen)
I’m not gonna give you my weapons.
(beat)
But I promise not to use them.
Deadpool turns to camera and addresses us directly.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
There are 206 bones in the human
body. 207 if I’m watching Gossip
Girl.
Deadpool HIGH-FIVES LOGAN’S SKELETAL HAND. Whispers:
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Here we go. Maximum Effort.
Music CUE: NSync, “Bye, Bye, Bye”.
5 EXT. NORTH DAKOTA - LOG NEAR GRAVE SITE - DAY 5
What happens next, happens FAST:
Deadpool flies out from behind the dirt pile. Holding Logan’s
skeleton by the neck.
DEADPOOL
Okay, Peanut. Guess we’re getting
that team up after all.
Deadpool lands as MINUTEMEN move in on him. Deadpool looks
like a fuckin’ god of war. With one jerk of his hand,
Deadpool snaps off one of WOLVERINE’s ADAMANTIUM RIB BONES.

He throws it violently toward an approaching soldier. We
track it through the air and see it’s engraved with “The
Marvel Cinematic Universe Presents.”
Every few strikes we speed-ramp down so we can read the
various bones entering bodies of screaming Minutemen. An
adamantium tibia breaks through a chest plate. As it
disappears into his body, we read, “A film by Shawn Levy”.
Yup... Wolverine’s bones and the carnage they wreak are also
OUR OPENING CREDITS.
...Then the THIGH-BONES, which have SHIN-BONES attached via
the cadaver’s TENDONS. We ramp down and zoom in to see:
Starring Mr. HUGH JACKMAN and so on...
Deadpool channels Bruce Lee, swinging the thigh/shin combos
around him like perfect makeshift NUNCHUCKS, mowing down
Minutemen like balsa wood: BOOM! CRACK! WHACK!
HELMETS go flying. RIBCAGES get cracked. FOREARMS suffer
COMPOUND FRACTURES.
Deadpool CHOKES a guy with the tendon connecting the two
bigger BONES, squeezing so hard the guy’s skull pops clean
OFF.
Next, Deadpool starts ripping remaining RIBS off Logan’s body
and THROWING/STABBING them into guys. MORE CREDITS left and
right. Men fly everywhere, gutted, leaking.
Deadpool kicks a skeleton head. *
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) *
Mullin! I’m outside the box. *
Deadpool finishes with the ribs, then grabs both CLAVICLES.
The clavicles PIERCE men’s joints and soft tissue. MORE
CREDITS.
Deadpool turns toward an onrushing MINUTEMAN. DP wields
Logan’s PELVIS to block the timestick-wielding Minuteman,
wrenching his arm right back and making him PRUNE HIMSELF
right out of existence.
Deadpool grabs Wolverine’s leg.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Come on, big fella.
As more Minutemen rush in, Deadpool reaches for...

...Wolverine’s FOREARMS.
He widens the bone structure of the forearms and slides both
arms into them like elbow length adamantium gloves. As a
gaggle of Minutemen approach, Deadpool touches the forearm
tendon...
SHNIKT.
Ooooohhhhh yeah. CLAWS POP and we widen now to reveal
Deadpool standing, backlit, hunched over. WOLVERINE’S CLAWS
PROTRUDE menacingly from Deadpool’s clenched fists.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
(to camera)
I am soaking wet right now.
Deadpool roars like a FUCKING ANIMAL... FREEZE the ACTION.
DEADPOOL (V.O.)
To be clear, I’m not proud of any
of this. The wanton violence. The
whiff of necrophilia. It isn’t who
I am. It isn’t who I want to be.
Who I want to be, well, to help you
understand that, I’ve gotta take
you back. To a simpler time.
FLASHBACKS take us back in time to...
6 INT. OFFICE - DAY 6
CLOSE ON A DESK CALENDAR. It reads MARCH, 2018. *
A CHYRON: “EARTH-616.” *
DEADPOOL (V.O)
I can’t believe I’m finally here.
I’ve waited for this moment for so
long.
INSERT: ECU of WADE nervously tapping his thigh. We see
CABLE’S TIME WATCH on his WRIST.
REVEAL: Wade Wilson. No mask, hoodie. The room is LITTERED
with BUSTER KEATON’S POSSESSIONS. His ICONIC MASK. AWARDS.
Elegance.
WADE
Thank you, sir. For seeing me. I
firmly believe that my services
could be of great use to your
organization.

Now, I know I was caught
“Smashturbating” in the lobby of
Stark Towers but I can assure you--
We finally flip the camera around and reveal the one and
only: HAROLD LLOYD, sitting behind the desk.
HAROLD LLOYD
Smashturb-- I’m sorry. What was
that?
WADE
Oh. No, I’m sorry. That’s when you
get those toy Hulk Hands, right,
and then you just look down, and
you just-- you brace yourself, and
you ravage the midsection--
HAROLD LLOYD
I get it, okay. Thank you. The
picture’s painted.
WADE
You get the gist.
Wade shifts uncomfortably. This ain’t going well.
HAROLD LLOYD
What exactly brings you here today?
WADE
Why am I--? Wow... Okay. I care...I
know I turn everything into a joke,
but I care, and I want to use that
feeling for something important. I
want to matter. And to show my girl
that I matter. And...
Wade looks behind him.
WADE (CONT’D)
I feel like I’m wasting the good
stuff here... is the Man not gonna
be joining us?
HAROLD LLOYD
The Man?
WADE
Yeah. I should save this if he’s
gonna--

As far as you’re concerned right
now, I’m the Man...
WADE
No.
HAROLD LLOYD
The Man is me. I am the Man in this
circumstance. He doesn’t do this
kind of thing anymore.
WADE
Cameos?
HAROLD LLOYD (CONT’D)
...Meetings. Entry level
meetings.
WADE (CONT’D)
Entry level? Aren’t you the *
Chauffeur, maybe...?
HAROLD LLOYD
A common misconception. I did begin
my career as Mr. Keaton’s driver.
WADE
Chauffeur.
HAROLD LLOYD
But quickly pivoted to the head of
security.
WADE
The head of-- yes, yes, yes.
HAROLD LLOYD
...And why I am vetting your *
resume.
(pivots)
You seem to have left out whether
or not you had any experience as a
member of a team. Could you maybe
add a little bit of perspective
there?
WADE
Oh no, yes. Of course. I was
Special Forces, but mainly I was
team leader -- founder, really -- *
of X-Force. Sadly, they all
perished in action.

HAROLD LLOYD
How exactly did that happen?
WADE
Well, the police say “gravity” but
just between us they didn’t test
well in the focus group, mainly
because of Cable.
HAROLD LLOYD
I see.
Harold makes another note in his file. Wade senses it is not
a good note.
WADE
Whoa, oh oh! I can see this isn’t
going well. Please stop writing. I
just... Look...
Wade’s eyes are wet with a burning sense of desperation.
WADE (CONT’D)
(swallows hard)
...I wanna be an Avenger.
Harold is taken aback. Puts down the pen.
WADE (CONT’D)
(emotional)
I want to be an Avenger.
HAROLD LLOYD
Why do you want to be an Avenger?
WADE
Because look around you. They’re
the best of the best. And what they
do matters. I need to be an
Avenger. Sir, my girl has kind of
had it with my shtick. And if I
don’t turn things around and do
something with my gifts, I don’t
think it’s really going to work out
for me, and I wouldn’t blame her. *
A beat. Harold consults Wade’s file. *
HAROLD LLOYD *
Avengers are a very unique group of *
superheroes that stand for
something more than just fighting
and wearing costumes.

WADE
I’m sorry, us? I wasn’t aware that
you were an Avenger...
HAROLD LLOYD
Avengers-adjacent, technically--
WADE
Oh wow, what’s your superpower? Is
it parallel parking? I’m so sorry.
That was cruel. I lash out when I’m
nervous. It won’t happen again.
HAROLD LLOYD
Let’s cut to the chase.
WADE
Please.
HAROLD LLOYD
You just said, moments ago, that
you wanted to be an Avenger because
you need it.
WADE
Yessir, I do.
HAROLD LLOYD
But the Avengers don’t do the job
because they need it. They do the
job because people need them. Do
you see the distinction?
WADE
Yessir. Please, Mr. Lloyd. I don’t
want to spend the rest of my life
like an annoying one trick pony.
HAROLD LLOYD *
Alright. *
Wade listens intently, eyes ablaze with heartache. Harold
stands, suggesting the meeting’s end.
WADE
Oh my god. You’re standing.
HAROLD LLOYD
Yeah, and now’s the time that we *
stand.

He puts his arm on Wade’s
shoulder)
The problem might be that you’re
reaching a little too high. Aim for
the middle and you’ll never miss,
right? I think you’ve got a good
heart. I believe what you’re
saying. But not everybody’s the
world-saving type. I’m not. But I’m
happy, right? I found my place.
Find your place.
Wade now stands in the open doorway. Crestfallen.
HAROLD LLOYD (CONT’D)
(feels bad for the guy)
Alright, get back out there. We’ll
keep an eye on you. Good luck.
Wade gives Harold a big hug. It lingers a little too long.
WADE
Alright, fetch the car. I want to
hit Shake Shack on the way home.
HAROLD LLOYD *
Really? Really? -- No, no, please. *
Wade pulls out of the hug...
WADE
Okay, thank you.
FADE OUT:
SHUNK. SHUNK. SHUNK. Over BLACK.
WADE (V.O.)
You know what they say. When one
door closes, your locker at work
opens.
7 INT. DRIVEMAX - LOCKER ROOM - DAY 7
A CHYRON: “EARTH-10005” “NOW.” *
TIGHT on WADE. STAPLE GUN in hand. He is STAPLING a holymother-fucking-shit CHESTNUT TOUPEE onto his bald head in
front of a locker room mirror.

The rhythmic SHUNK of the stapler becomes the hooky beat to 
George Michael’s “FREEDOM! ‘90” as we see other quick tight 
cuts:
A final adjustment of the toupee, the straightening of a 
NAMETAG reading ‘WADE,’ the buttoning of the cuffs on a crisp 
long sleeve, the cinching of laces on a pair of Skechers 
Shape-Ups. The smoothing of merkin eyebrows.
WIDER NOW: It’s Wade 2.0. Final checks in the locker room 
mirror. Ready for sales-floor action.
WADE
Now let’s go sell some certified 
pre-owned vehicles, motherfuck--
8 INT. KIA CARNIVAL - DAY 8
WADE is now sitting ‘bitch’ in the rear bench seat of a KIA 
CARNIVAL MINIVAN. We see only his FACE and scrunched knees in 
the rear-view mirror. 
Surrounding him in the van is a YOUNG FAMILY, the CHIPMANS - 
PARENTS in front taking the van for a test-drive, MR. CHIPMAN 
behind the wheel, MRS. CHIPMAN riding shotgun, BOYS (11 and 
8) flanking Wade in the back.
WADE
Technically, the Carnival is not 
a...
(voice drops out)
...minivan...
(back full volume)
..it’s an ‘MPV.’ So everybody gets *
to keep their testicles. *
MRS. CHIPMAN
So how does the Kia compare to the 
Honda Odyssey?
WADE
That’s a great question. Um, it 
doesn’t fucking suck.
MRS. CHIPMAN
(’language’)
You know, you can answer the 
question without swearing.
WADE
I’m sorry, Tammy! I don’t have 
kids. Not that I haven’t dreamt of 
that, but I don’t have a lot of 
vaginal sex.

PETER (O.C.)
You’ll get ‘em next time.
REVERSE ANGLE to REVEAL: PETER. That’s right. Peter is back.
In all his moustachioed glory.
He wears a polo and wrinkle-free khakis. Peter grabs his
jacket out of his locker.
PETER (CONT’D)
And look, you can always go back to
superheroing. I mean, I know I’d
like to see you back in the suit. I
don’t keep it in my locker so that
I can wear it.
Peter laughs with longing.
PETER (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
I keep it in my locker in case we
need to saddle up again.
We see the Deadpool suit in all its glory. Hanging casually
on a shitty hangar in a locker. Inert. Wade looks at it. Then:
WADE
Hey, hey hey. What is it doing in
there? I’m done. I’m done, and I’m
fine with being done. Look, is
sales the best match? Probably not. Is this the life that I always
imagined for myself? Fuck no. But
this is the right fit for me, Sugar
Bear. It is.
PETER
Okay, Mr. Wilson.

We’re human beings. We crave 
purpose. After all, we’re Deadpool. 
WADE
Please, stop saying that. We’re not 
Deadpool. I’m not even Deadpool 
anymore.
PETER
Well, if you’re gonna have a 
midlife crisis... go BIG. A few 
years ago, a friend of mine got his 
nipples pierced with a titanium 
chain that goes down and attaches 
to his Van-Johnson.
Peter and Wade dismount from their bikes. As Peter locks the 
bikes outside Wade’s building, Wade gets distracted. A weird 
feeling coming over him, almost like he’s being watched. He 
looks across the street...
PETER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Are you feeling grumplestilskin 
‘cause it’s your birthday? 
Across the street Wade sees CONSTRUCTION WORKERS busying 
themselves at a SUBWAY ENTRANCE down the block. 
WADE

What?... No...
Wade can’t put his finger on the feeling, and heads inside 
his building.

WADE
Hey! You guys are lucky I’m not

CHEERS all around. Peter claps Wade on the back. Wade ekes 
out a smile for everyone’s benefit but his own.
Wade accepts hugs from around the room: BLIND AL, VANESSA, of 
course. DOPINDER. COLOSSUS. BUCK. NTW and YUKIO. SHATTERSTAR.

VANESSA approaches Wade:
WADE
Thanks for coming.
VANESSA
Yeah.
WADE
How’s work?
VANESSA
Oh, I got a promotion.
WADE
No way.

Yeah. It’s mind numbing middle

Vanessa smiles. Wade tries to.
VANESSA

WADE
No, no. I live in a one bedroom

Okay. Alright.
15 INT. WADE’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - EVENING 15
EVERYONE gathered around a CANDLELIT BIRTHDAY CAKE. In the
middle of the cake sits a SMALL PHOTOGRAPH on a mini plastic
easel. The picture shows ALL OF WADE’S FRIENDS, smiling.
EVERYONE
--Happy birthday to you!
Speech! Speech! Speech!
Wade quiets the room. It is filled with LOVE.
WADE

Wade makes eye contact with Vanessa. Pushes on...

I’m the luckiest man alive.
VANESSA
Make a wish, buddy.
WADE
Ten-four good buddy. Going down.
Wade takes the little easel and photo off the top of the cake
as he prepares to blow out the candles. We rack focus past
the candles to Wade’s smiling face. The flames light his

Wade blows out the candles. Over BLACK. SUDDENLY:

We’re kissing, alright. Which song

Wade looks back into the room to make sure nobody can hear 
him. The MINUTEMAN in the middle raises one of those 
ubiquitous ‘Timesticks’...
WADE (CONT’D)
Whoa, whoa. Is that supposed to be 
scary? Pegging isn’t new for me, 
friendo. 
(winks)
But it is for Disney. 
The MINUTEMEN take a step toward Wade. 
WADE (CONT’D)
Ah-ta-ta... look, I’ve never been a 
natural bottom so we’re going to 
take things real slow and I want 
some crazy eye contact. Not you.
(pointing)
You. I can’t see your eyes through

We’re going to move on down the

UNMASKED MINUTEMAN
I don’t like you.
WADE
Yes. Let’s hold onto that attitude

His toupée lands on the floor where he just stood.
17 INT. TVA - ASSESSMENT ROOM - LATER 17
WADE sits in a chair at a table in the center of a big, dark
room. He is slumped over, FOREHEAD on the surface of the
table. The staples remain in his skull with tiny remnant
patches of hair connected to them. Suddenly, he AWAKENS,
gasps, and sits straight up. He finds himself ACROSS FROM:
...a very dapper MAN in a perfectly tailored suit, sitting on
the other side of the table.
This is MR. PARADOX. He looks all business but speaks like a
super chill yoga instructor.
Wade looks around, disoriented. He spies the room.
MR. PARADOX
Mr. Wilson. You appear to have
soiled yourself while unconscious.
WADE
I wasn’t unconscious. Who are you?
MR. PARADOX
I go by the name of Paradox. Mr. *
Paradox. And you’re sitting here at
the TVA. The Time Variance
Authority. We’re really a watchdog
organization, except we’re more
lighthearted than that sounds. With
a sort of throwback ironic twist.
And we’re in charge of defending
what’s known as the ‘Sacred
Timeline.’
WADE
That is a shit-ton of exposition
for a threequel. Is this because I
used Cable’s time machine? I *
brought a couple of people back to *
life. Then I destroyed it. That was *
a long time ago...
MR. PARADOX
Yes, we’re aware of your abuse of
your timeline. And you were so
abusive of it. And no, it has
nothing to do with that. Walk with
me.

Elevator doors open and we reveal: A sprawling room of
systems and the incomprehensible management of
incomprehensibly important things. We sure as hell didn’t see
THIS room on LOKI.
The expansive room is split by an elevated PIER-like
structure on which Mr. Paradox and Wade stand. A BAY OF
MONITORS flood the south wall, on which we see various shots
of the toupéed WADE going in and out of his APARTMENT. Coming
home from work. SMOKING cigarettes with PETER. A mountain of
footage. They’ve been watching him for a long time.
WADE
Wow.
MR. PARADOX
(nods)
I brought you here, Mr. Wilson, to
tell you that you’re special. In
fact, you’ve been chosen. For a
higher purpose. A purpose unclear
even to me, but one that could save
the entire Sacred Timeline from a
possibly grisly fate sometime in
the future, which may very well
need to be AVENGED.
Wade is hanging on every word.
WADE
This Sacred Timeline. I assume I’m
going to marvel at how cinematic it
feels? Gratuitous cameos?
Indiscriminate use of variants? The
whole package?
MR. PARADOX
(with meaning)
You tell me.
Mr. Paradox waves to monitors filled with incredible scenes
from classic MCU movies. Iron Man faces Iron Monger in Iron
Man. Hawkeye drops Natasha to her death in Endgame. The
airport battle from Civil War.
And right there in the middle of the action, kicking an
unholy amount of ass, is CAPTAIN AMERICA himself. Fighting
WINTER SOLDIER. Beating the shit out of IRON MAN, etc.

WADE
The subway station.
MR. PARADOX
The TVA outpost, yes.
WADE
And what is that? 
We see a quick image from the future. THOR cradles DEADPOOL’S 
broken and battered body. Thor holds back tears.
WADE (CONT’D)
Is that me? Is that Thor? Is he 
crying?
Mr. Paradox quickly changes the channel. 
MR. PARADOX
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. 
That happens in the distant future. *
WADE
(to a TVA employee)
Why is Thor crying? Quick. Tell me.
MR. PARADOX *
Do not look at her. Stop that. Eyes *
on me. I brought you here to offer *
you an opportunity. The opportunity 
you sought years ago but for which 
you were not ready. We believe 
you’re ready now. Ready for a 
chance to leave your timeline. And 
join the greatest universe of all.
I’m about to give you the thing 
you’ve always wanted.

Wade walks away a few feet. Turns to camera. Grabs it by the

Suck it, Fox. I’m going to

MR. PARADOX 
Yeah, I don’t think you quite 
understand. You will not be 
returning to your home because 
there will be no home to return to.
DEADPOOL
Come again? This time, in my ears?
Mr. Paradox turns to the MONITOR BAY, motions to a 
technician, and a DAZZLING GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION of the 
FOX UNIVERSE comes up.
MR. PARADOX 
This is your universe, Mr. Wilson. 
The image zooms into a dark, sickly DEAD ZONE in the TANGLED 
THREADS OF REALITY. As they watch, DECAY from the dead zone 
spreads to the healthy threads around it. 
MR. PARADOX (CONT’D)
That is what happens when a 
universe loses their “Anchor 
Being.” See how it decays from the 
inside? This is how a reality dies.
DEADPOOL
What’s an “Anchor Being?” 
MR. PARADOX 
An Anchor Being is an entity of 
such vital importance that when 
they die, their whole world slowly 
withers out of existence. 
DEADPOOL 
You’ve just won the lottery because 
I didn’t die, it’s just a little 
mid-life crisis. I’m better now.

MR. PARADOX (CONT’D) *
I am referring of course to Logan. *

A chill falls over the room. Mr. Paradox brings Wade’s

from Logan (2017) play out on screen. 
LOGAN *
Don’t be what they made you. *
Mr. Paradox mouths the words. *
MR. PARADOX *

So this is what it feels like. *
DEADPOOL
Logan? Of course. Logan. LOGAN?! 
The guy with... forks for hands? 
That Wolverine?! 
The gravity of the situation is starting to dawn on Deadpool. 
He turns to the monitor frantically, scanning the spreading 
decay. 
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Yeah, I got it. You can turn it 
off. Make it stop.
MR. PARADOX 
We’re not doing it, Mr. Wilson. We

DEADPOOL
What’s that mean?
MR. PARADOX
It means I’ve been tasked with
overseeing the end of your
universe, and regardless of what
the pencil pushers upstairs would
prefer, I will not waste my life
watching it die slowly of natural
causes. We used to just prune these
things. Simple, elegant, efficient, *
but I’m told the TVA doesn’t like *
to do that anymore. Well, I do. And *
no matter what my so-called *
superiors say, the multiverse does *
not need a babysitter...we need a *
mercy killer. And in this instance, *
I am the mercy killer. *
Mr. Paradox presses a few buttons and the MONITORS show a TVA
TECH CREW building a scary REACTOR-BOMB like device inside
the retro-fitted subway stop across the street from Wade’s
apartment. This is the TIME RIPPER.
DEADPOOL
What is that?! *
MR. PARADOX
That’s a time ripper, Mr. Wilson.
An accelerant. Once completed it
will allow me to destroy the
spacetime matrix of your universe.
You see, I don’t want to work for
the TVA, I want to be the TVA. And
my first order of business will be *
giving your universe a swift and *
compassionate end. Instead of a
slow, cruel, natural death, your
universe will simply blink out of *
existence. And don’t worry, your *
friends won’t feel a thing. It will *
be over just like this -- “Oh, *
what’s that?” Ah. Trust me. *
DEADPOOL
No. You’re going to Old Yeller my *

your days of insignificance and

Deadpool looks down at his fancy new costume. Over to the
monitors showing the SACRED TIMELINE.
Deadpool nods reluctantly.
DEADPOOL
That’s all I’ve ever really wanted.

Yup. I’ll do it.

DEADPOOL smacks the TEMPAD OUT OF Mr. Paradox’s hands,

takes off after it. Two Minutemen stand in his way,

TemPad, directly over the EYE FUCKER, who’s back at his desk 
below, now GAPING at the prospect of getting pancaked. 
Deadpool grabs the TemPad midair, hits the button and opens a 
time door, which he falls through. His left hand is the last 
to disappear, reaching for the EYE FUCKER.
ZAP! The time door zips closed, and Deadpool DISAPPEARS. 
The eye fucker blinks, realizes his MUG is MISSING from his

Mr. Paradox, blood pouring from his nose, slowly turns to the

Deadpool roars like a FUCKING ANIMAL and rushes the

DEADPOOL (V.O.)
And boy did he ever. Which brings 
us back to this. The desecration of 
the sacred corpse.
Deadpool seems possessed. Animalistic. He charges the TVA 
SWAT AGENTS. Deadpool wields Logan’s claws. The energy 
quickens along with our pulse.
Only, it’s not what you’d expect. Wielding the adamantium 
claws is not as easy as the protein snorting Aussie fuck 
makes it look. In short, Deadpool SUCKS at this. It’s messy, 
inelegant. Sure he nails a few bad guys, but also stabs 
himself. He gets claws stuck in everything.

And the only thing worth a shit to

In the blink of an eye, Deadpool closes the gap. And before 
the Agent can blink, one of Deadpool’s swords is through his 
jaw and protrudes from the back of his skull. Deadpool is an 
inch from his face. 
DEADPOOL
Get my country’s name out of your 
fucking MOUTH.

And my sword. Give me that.
The Agent falls out of frame, dead. As Deadpool looks around,

AGE OF APOCALYPSE WOLVERINE. 
DEADPOOL
Ahoy! Everything seems to be on *
fire. Do you have a dragon? Quick *
q. Are you an Anchor Being by *
chance? *
25 INT. MADRIPOOR CASINO - NIGHT 25*
DEADPOOL finds himself in a swanky private back room of a *
casino. SCANTILY-CLAD BEAUTIES serve drinks to high-rollers. *
Deadpool spots the man he’s looking for at a BACCARAT TABLE. *
An EYE-PATCH WEARING WOLVIE in a dapper white tuxedo (PATCH) *
plays baccarat with an air of sophistication and panache. *
DEADPOOL *
Logan. *
27 INT. INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE - DAY 27*
Deadpool walks in. We see someone in silhouette from behind *
working on a vintage motorcycle. Smoke curls from either side *
of his backlit head. His muscular form dominates our frame. *
Iconic. Powerful. *

outside. 
DEADPOOL
Howdy! I’m just -- I’m auditioning *

He SHOOTS Deadpool off the porch. *

Deadpool finds BROWN AND YELLOW WOLVERINE. *

Oh yes, yes. Classic John Byrne *

Deadpool turns to find The Hulk towering over him. *
DEADPOOL (CONT’D) *

The Hulk sends Deadpool flying. *
BACK TO MADRIPOOR CASINO:
Patch calmly puts his hand behind Deadpool’s head. SHNIKT! 
The claws POP OUT THE FRONT of Deadpool’s skull. Blood 
splatters on Patch’s white tuxedo, and everyone else in the

Deadpool exits through a time door. *
BACK TO INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSE WOLVERINE:
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
You know, from behind you look a
little bit like Hopper-- oh my
fuck!
Wolverine turns around and it’s HOPPER-FUCKING-RENE.
Stogie between clenched teeth. The hair. The beard. The whole
nine yards. And dare I say, he makes a compelling Wolverine.
I mean... If things don’t pan out with Hugh...
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
The Hopper-rene. The legends are
true. And may I say, sir. On behalf
of all of humanity... This just
feels right. We will treat you so
much better than those shit fucks
down the street--
HOPPER-RENE
You were just leaving.
DEADPOOL
No, sir. Not while the fate of my *
universe is at stake -- *
Before DP can finish his sentence, Hopper-rene loads his arms
Mission Impossible style. Claws protract from each fist and
BOOM! He sends Deadpool through multiple pillars. Before
Deadpool hits a final one and the wall, he’s opened another
time door and WHOOSHES INTO:
28 INT. SEEDY CANADIAN BAR - DAY 28
DEADPOOL flies in backwards, continuing the momentum from
“Hopper-rene”, taking out a patron’s beer. He rolls up and
onto his feet. The PATRON takes an aggressive SWING. Deadpool
very nonchalantly - almost elegantly - catches the man by the
throat, mashing his carotid artery with his thumb and
lowering him silently out of frame.
DEADPOOL
(seeing Wolverine)
Ooh, this one looks promising.

Down you go.
Lowlifes inhabit the corners. Deadpool scans the room, his
eyes landing on a lone figure slumped at the end of the bar.
The silhouette of his hairstyle leaves no room for ambiguity
about who this solitary figure is.
CLOSER NOW:
With LOGAN, a depressed loner in jeans and a work jacket.
He’s drunk. Haunted by things only he can see.
He downs a shot of WHISKY and taps the bar.
LOGAN
Again.
The BARTENDER leans in ominously.
BARTENDER
I told ya you’re not welcome here.
You’re not welcome anywhere, now
get the fuck outta my bar.
Logan locks eyes with the Bartender. We expect rage. We get a
flicker of shame.
LOGAN
Just give me one more drink, and
then I’ll leave.
BARTENDER
That’s not how it works.
DEADPOOL (O.S.)
It does now. Leave the bottle.
CAMERA WRAPS TO REVEAL Deadpool is now seated on the stool
right next to Logan. He refills Logan’s glass. Logan stares
glassy-eyed at Deadpool for a beat too long. Where’s this
going?
LOGAN
I know you, Bub?
DEADPOOL
Nope. But I know you.
He smiles. Then with a hint of sadness:
LOGAN
Everybody knows me. I’m The
Wolverine.

LOGAN
Look, Lady. I’m not interested.
DEADPOOL
Really gettin’ into your cups here.
LOGAN
Why would I go with you?
DEADPOOL
(deadly serious)
Because unfortunately I need you.
And even more unfortunately, my
entire world needs you.
BARTENDER
You two gonna fuck or fight?
Deadpool looks back and forth from Wolvie to the Bartender.
DEADPOOL
You gonna take that from him?
A beat.
WOLVERINE
Yup.
DEADPOOL
I can see you have a whole haunted *
inner world that I’m guessing we’ll *
get to unpack later, but every *
other Wolverine would have really *
hurt me by now, and I’m sorta of on *
the tick-tick, so upsee-daysey...!
Here we go.
Deadpool hoists Logan up. Logan awkwardly smacks Deadpool’s
hand off and takes an unsteady fight stance.
WOLVERINE
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
DEADPOOL

BARTENDER
Get that piece of shit outta my bar-

Without looking away from Logan, and in a lightning fast
move, Deadpool whips Logan’s highball at the Bartender. It
pulverizes into his forehead as the Bartender disappears
behind the bar, moaning in pain.
DEADPOOL
He’s not a piece of shit. He’s an
Anchor Being, and he’s coming with
me.
On Logan. SNIKT. Claws out.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Oh, Whiskey dick of the claws. It’s
quite common in Wolverines over
forty.
LOGAN
You don’t want this.
Lightening fast, DP points a Desert Eagle at Logan’s face. We
zoom in on its engraved muzzle: “Smile And Wait For The
Flash.”
DEADPOOL
You’re right. And you don’t want
this. But unless you wanna take a
deep breath through your fucking
forehead, I suggest you reconsider.
Let’s go, Peanut.
With enough booze in him to kill Winston Churchill:
LOGAN
Hold on, hold on, hold on. Watch
this. Alright. Easy.
Logan grabs the BOTTLE, drinking its entire contents.
DEADPOOL
Good god. Thirsty little honey
badger, aren’t you? It’s okay, keep
going. Audiences are accustomed to
long run times.
Logan keels forward, face-planting on the ground,
unconscious.

Okay, here we-- *

Oh, look at those pjs. That only

HARD CUT TO:
29 INT. TVA - COMMAND CENTER 29
Deadpool steps through a time door with an unconscious
Wolverine in all his GLORY, wearing his YELLOW and BLUE
suit.(But not yet wearing his mask. We save that for later.)
MR. PARADOX and his BUREAUCRATS monitor the progress of the
Time Ripper. They turn to see Deadpool lugging the passed-out
Wolverine towards them.
DEADPOOL
I got a big surprise. Here’s your
Anchor Being, baby girl. This Logan
has the same he-can-do-anything- *
even-musicals look, and bonus: he’s
actually wearing a costume like
he’s not embarrassed to be in a
superhero movie for once.
Deadpool barely registers as Logan falls over, landing at an
extremely odd angle. It’s ugly.
MR. PARADOX
I don’t understand.
DEADPOOL
You said my universe is dying
because this sack of nuts got
himself killed. Well, problem
solved. *
A long beat as Mr. Paradox seems to consider Deadpool’s
offering. Then, Mr. Paradox breaks into laughter. Not just
laughter, though. A massive full-body guffaw.
MR. PARADOX
Oh my god. You actually think you
can replace an Anchor Being? With
THIS?? I wouldn’t have accepted ANY
other Wolverine, btws, but you have
outdone yourself and brought me the
WORST Wolverine!

ANGLE ON Logan, still prone on the ground, but eyes OPEN. 
He’s heard every word.
DEADPOOL
Whaddya mean ‘the worst’ one?
MR. PARADOX 
Mr. Wilson. This Wolverine let down 
his entire world. He’s the stuff of 
legend. But not in a good way.
CLOSE ON LOGAN’s wet eyes, fixated on the middle distance. 
Listening.
MR. PARADOX (CONT’D)
What he did? Well. Some things are 
just beyond forgiveness.
DEADPOOL
Ok... how do I make this right? 
I’ll do anything. 
MR. PARADOX
I gave you a chance at greatness. 
Because my superiors deemed you 
special. Clearly not “special” in a 
good way, but apparently you have *
some important future purpose to *
serve. *
DEADPOOL *
With Thor. He holds me. *
MR. PARADOX *
But I did my duty. I gave you the *
opportunity to be somebody. And *
instead of accepting my offering 
with humility and gratitude, you 
broke my nose. *
DEADPOOL
It looks great.
MR. PARADOX
And you decimated dozens of my men 
with the exhumed corpse of a hero. 
Dishonoring not only his remains, 
but his memory.
DEADPOOL

A TVA tech brings Mr. Paradox a sandwich. He speaks with his 
mouth full, underscoring a lack of genuine concern.

And there’s no stopping it. The

DEADPOOL
Is the thought of vaporizing my
universe making you peckish?
MR. PARADOX
(non-plussed) *
Think of the sacred timeline as a *
garden. I pull out the weeds. But *
we don’t blame the gardener, do we? *
DEADPOOL *
How about I fuck the gardener with *
a rusty ice skate? I’m about to *
lose everything that I’ve ever
cared about because that hairy
thundercunt from down undercunt
finally dies and-- he’s back on his *
feet again, isn’t he? *
REVEAL: Behind Deadpool we see a groggy WOLVERINE rise into
frame. He looks rather... Unhappy.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
(ostensibly to Wolverine) *
Welcome back. You smell amazing by *

I want to talk to your boss. I want
you to get them on the phone, and
you tell him/her/or they that

Wolverine’s free hand/claws dip below frame. He impales DP in 
what we can only assume is his perineum. He lifts him above 
his head and with the force of a thousand wrestlers, slams 
Deadpool down on his knee with the ultimate back breaker. 
Deadpool GROANS and WRITHES on the ground, clutching at his 
back. 
DEADPOOL
AAAAH! Were you even listening back 
there?! If we don’t make it back to

Wolverine dusts himself off. Takes a last look around. 
WOLVERINE
Not my fucking problem. 
Wolverine turns and walks away. *
DEADPOOL
That’s all you got? Is that what 
you said when your world went to

Wolverine stops in his tracks. Turns his head. Seething. 
WOLVERINE

Deadpool looks around, trying to get his bearings, his back 
to Wolverine...unaware he’s just poked a bear.
DEADPOOL
Yeah, I heard all about you. How 
you screwed up everything. You

you out of that bed you shit in--

the ground with Wolvie on top of him.
Deadpool unloads BOTH guns into Wolvie’s ribs, but the *
sonofabitch takes his medicine strong. *
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Are you ready to be calm now? *
He slams his head back, crushing Deadpool’s nose before *
flinging him away. Deadpool rolls and SLAMS to a stop against *
a half-buried piece of stone. It’s the ancient 20TH CENTURY *
FOX LOGO. *
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Rest in pieces, Fox.
Low angle on Deadpool between Wolvie’s feet. We see the
bullets that were inside Wolvie drop to the ground with a
“PING” sound. Then another. And another. Until all 20 bullets
rain down in a clatter.
Close on Wolverine’s face. He exhales gun-smoke from his nose
and produces one more bullet between his teeth. Spits it to
the side and hunches down like a coiled panther.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
I don’t want to fight you, Peanut.
It doesn’t matter what you did. I

The fight’s intense. Builds in speed. And builds. And BUILDS

preparing to DECAPITATE HIM.

Wait wait wait! I can fix it! I can

Wolverine hesitates.

down a switch on A GIANT MAGNET TRUCK.
WHOOSH!!! Instantly, Wolverine flies into Deadpool, pulled
backwards by the force of the magnet. Deadpool hits the giant
magnet first before being pinned by Logan’s metallic body.
DEADPOOL

Deadpool looks up just in time to see a big DETACHED SENTINEL
BOOT flying towards them at rocket speed, also pulled by the
magnet.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Holy shit--
WOLVERINE *
Oh fuck. *
The metallic SENTINEL BOOT hits them with the force of a
cannonball.
BLACK OUT.
34 I/E. PRISON TRUCK CAGE - DAY 34
The marauder caravan makes its way across the vast landscape
of the Void.
Wolverine startles awake in a SPHERICAL CAGE being dragged
across the barren landscape. He’s BOUND CHEST TO CHEST WITH
DEADPOOL.
Deadpool’s head rests on Wolverine’s shoulder.
Deadpool raises his head, coming face-to-face with a very
annoyed Wolverine.
DEADPOOL
How long was I asleep?
WOLVERINE
(glances down)
Not all of you was asleep.
SNIKT! Wolverine pops his claws, but the way he’s tied they
just extend helplessly into the air. JONATHAN watches from
the other side of the “prison ball”. Coiled in non-flammable
metal chains.
JONATHAN
Don’t bother. They’re very
thorough.
WOLVERINE
If you know where we are, start
talking.
JONATHAN
You’re in the Void. Think of it as

DEADPOOL
What does the annihilating?
JONATHAN
Alioth.
DEADPOOL
Okay. As long as it’s

purple cloud monster or 
something.
JONATHAN (CONT’D)
Alioth is a big purple cloud 
monster.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Fuck, my mouth. *
JONATHAN
Everyone here’s on the run from 
Alioth. Most don’t make it. There’s 
a resistance though. Other people 
like us that managed to survive. 
They’re hiding out in the 
borderlands. Trying to find a way 
the fuck out of here. 
WOLVERINE
Then that’s where we go.
That gets Deadpool’s attention. *
WOLVERINE (CONT’D)
These others. They can take us back 
to the TVA. Make them fix things. *
DEADPOOL *
Us? We? A team? The answer is yes. *
Shake on it. *

Who’s ‘she?’
Deadpool looks up curiously toward a rusted CCTV camera at 
the top of the cell. (We may revisit this later.)
JONATHAN
In the void, you’re either food for 
Alioth... or you work for Her...
We widen out as the convoy makes its way across the epic 
nothingness of the void. 
35 EXT. GIANT SKELETAL ARENA - DAY 35
The CARAVAN approaches the MASSIVE CARCASS of a GIANT 
SKELETON. 
The humongous body lays on its stomach, its skeletal CHIN 
resting on the ground. Its arms extend in front of it, 
creating a massive ARENA-LIKE CIRCLE, its TWO GIANT GLOVED 
HANDS overlapping to form a GATE.
36 EXT. GIANT SKELETAL ARENA - DAY 36
As the CARAVAN APPROACHES, the MASSIVE HANDS begin to part. 
The “gate” opens, a mechanical pulley-system being operated 
by the BLOB atop the rampart.
The PRISON TRUCK pulls in. There is a hive of activity.
Henchmen eye our heroes suspiciously. Among them is a massive 
JUGGERNAUT VARIANT, complete with a Vinnie Jones-style 
Helmet.
Jonathan gets yanked out and flung on the ground. Deadpool 
and Wolverine get shoved out of the cage into the “arena” of 
the GIANT SKELETAL arms. Wolverine lands on top of Deadpool, 
repaying the Headbutt. OTHER HENCHMEN shove the other 
prisoner from inside the other cage-ball-- who we now notice 
is the Minuteman Deadpool made self-prune in the Logan grave 
fight sequence!-- onto the ground. A HORN rings out. The 
CROWD goes silent. 
Then movement and a groaning creak from the Giant Skeletal 
head, as the mask rises, revealing the rotted carcass of a 
skull inside.

JUGGERNAUT
(pulls them up from 
ground)
Alright, keep your voices down. She 
don’t like the chatter. 
WOLVERINE
(to: Deadpool)
She’s gonna love you. 
Out of the darkness of the skull’s jaw, an old, decrepit 
figure wheels out on an ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR WHEEL CHAIR. The 
figure’s head is turned down, obscuring their face but 
revealing a BALD-HEAD.
DEADPOOL
Is that--is that Charles?! 
(to the figure)
HEY, CHUCK! It’s us! 
Wolverine’s expression darkens. 
WOLVERINE
That’s not Chuck. 
JONATHAN
Oh shit.
The bald head rises, revealing the sweet smile of CASSANDRA 
NOVA. In silhouette, she’s the mirror-image of Charles 
Xavier. 
Cassandra rolls forward in the rickety, battle-damaged and 
BLOOD-STAINED wheelchair. She comes to a stop, then stands up 
and walks down from the giant skull toward our heroes.
DEADPOOL
Oh, ableism. Great. That’s not 
gonna go over well with the woke 
mob.
Cassandra is curiously cheery, assessing Deadpool and 
Wolverine...but something is off.

You know him? You know Chuck? 
CASSANDRA NOVA
Oh, I knew him. We shared a womb. 
Tried to strangle the sly little

Amen. I’ve never loved roommates. 
Mine’s blind. Except she can see

Charles Xavier’s twin. Cassandra

WOLVERINE
Bullshit.
DEADPOOL
I was an anal birth.
CASSANDRA NOVA
You two are cute. I have a good 
feeling about this. 
With a gesture, she FREES THEM OF THEIR CHAINS, then, she 
walks towards Jonathan Byers. 
CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
And I’ve been trying to catch this 
little firefly for years, haven’t 
I, Johnny? You picked the wrong

CASSANDRA NOVA

You said all that about me? 
JONATHAN
No. NO. I didn’t say any of that...
DEADPOOL

Sticks ‘n stones, Johnny! Don’t let

said in the convoy: “this fingerlickin’ dead-inside Pixie slab of 
third rate dime-store nut-milk can 
eat your delicious cinnamon ring 
and kick rocks all the way to bald 
hell.” 
JONATHAN
(to Cassandra, pure panic)
Okay, I’ve never said any of those 
words in my entire life. 
DEADPOOL
HA! The modesty. People think I’m a 
shit-talker. But this guy? Is next

JONATHAN
No. He... No. What? I don’t even

DEADPOOL
My hats off to you, sir. Truly.
37 EXT. GIANT SKELETAL ARENA - DAY 37
WHOOSH.
All the skin on Jonathan’s body rips away in a blink. The 
blood, organs, and bone all hang in the air for a moment 
before gush-thumping to the ground in a hideous pile of 
lungs, heart, liver, blood, and bones. The spine and skull 
stay upright in the viscera-pile for an agonizing extra 
beat...before tipping over like a limp tree in the woods.

In the distance, Deadpool clocks a GIANT WHIRLING PURPLE 
CLOUD on the horizon. Cassandra walks toward it, looking out 
at the horizon. 
DEADPOOL
There’s been some kind of mistake. *
Big Yellow is a backup Anchor *
Being, and I’m Marvel Jesus. MJ if

It was the best thing that ever *
happened to me. I love it here. *

You live in a garbage dump.

Wolverine LUNGES at Cassandra. Cassandra stops him in his
tracks and then, with a wave, flings him back and into the
ground. Buried alive.
His SIX-CLAWS poke up out of the ground, the only part of him
still visible. Cassandra motions again, and the claws cut
through the ground as the subterranean Logan is shoved away.
The claws cut through the dirt like a SHARK-FIN through
water.
DEADPOOL
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t want the
smoke. I don’t have any beef with
you. I just want to save my
friends. I just-- I want to go
home.
CASSANDRA NOVA
Well the thing is I could get you
home.
DEADPOOL

CASSANDRA NOVA
But I don’t...want to? *
Suddenly, impossibly, Cassandra Nova is BEHIND him,
whispering in his ear. Deadpool is frozen, powerless...
CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
What DO you want, Wade Wilson?
Her hand SNAKES up the back of his head, a seductive scalp
massage.
DEADPOOL
Your fingers are inside me, but not
in a good way.

My brother could enter one’s mind

I’ve got you...
We see KALEIDOSCOPIC FLASHES of Deadpool/Wade from the first 
two movies; images of heroism, joy, connection. The images 
swirl into a flashback of BUSTER KEATON, saying the words 
that will break Wade’s heart. Another shot shows us HAROLD 
LLOYD escorting Wade out. We hold on Wade’s crestfallen 
visage as the door closes behind him. Then we see Wade 
staring at his Deadpool suit, eyes listless. Then in his new 
uniform at DriveMax. We see him standing outside in the 
middle of the car lot. Sad. Lost.
40 INT. WADE’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - DAY 40
Other flashes of Wade as VANESSA breaks up with him...Wade’s 
pain is etched all over his face. Vanessa reaches for his 
hand, eyes empathetic... *

VANESSA *
I just feel like I don’t know where *
you are. I can’t reach you. You’re *

VANESSA *
No, you’re not. I can’t-- *

VANESSA *
Then show me. You’ve got to do 
something.

Deadpool is in fact staring at Cassandra who is the real 
source of the voice.

CASSANDRA NOVA
If you want to kill me it’s gonna

Jump scare! Wolvie sinks BOTH CLAWS into her back. Cassandra
looks down at the claws poking through her chest. She arches
back, writhing in pain.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Ha, ha, ha! My boy’s WICKED STRONG!
That’s my BIG BOY! Yes, you are.
Cassandra looks down at the claws still protruding from her
torso. *
She smacks her open hand against her chest like swatting a
fly. Violently forcing Wolvie’s arms/claws out of her and
sending Wolvie skittering back.
Cassandra squares off to face Wolvie and Deadpool. In the
distance behind her, closing in fast, ALIOTH is now near-- a
monstrous purple cloud monster speeding through the sky and
coming in hot.
CASSANDRA
(heads back to her SKULL)
Well this has been fun, but the big
guy needs to eat and the rent is
due. By the way, you’re the rent.
Alioth looms massive in the air. The bound Minuteman prisoner
shakes and whimpers feebly, knowing the end is near. Deadpool
and Wolverine look over at him.

You’ve seen the file on earth one *
triple zero five. It’s teeming with *
troublemakers. *
B-15 *
Remember, your job is to do *
nothing. Make sure others do *
nothing. Do it long enough, maybe *

MR. PARADOX *
Sit in your chair and do nothing. *

Did I detect a tone? *
MR. PARADOX *
A tone? *

is back on.
DEADPOOL *
I don’t mean to be a downer, but we *
have a lot to do. Find these other *
survivors hiding god knows where, *
force Cassandra to get us out of *
the Void, stop Paradox from *

Good god, right. This plot *

WOLVERINE *
Was?
DEADPOOL
Huh?
WOLVERINE
Back in the diner you said, “was”. 
Logan was a hero. What happened? 
Deadpool stops walking. Reluctant to share...
DEADPOOL
You died. 
WOLVERINE
How?
DEADPOOL
Well, technically, you were chestfucked by a tree. But really?
(solemnly)
Ya just ran outta batteries trying 
to save someone.
WOLVERINE
Who?
DEADPOOL
The shitheels that grew her in a 
lab called her Lemon. But she was 
just a kid. A younger, daintier, 
somehow meaner version of you. You 
died trying to save her. It was 
beautiful.
Wolverine walks on. Deadpool too, clocking Logan.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
Look, mijo, I know you’re hurting. 
My blind elderly, African American 
roommate, Blind Al always says that 
pain teaches us who we are.

No. That’s her NAME? You call her

DEADPOOL
Well, she’s blind.
47 EXT. THE VOID - HILLY TERRAIN - DAY 47
Suddenly, an ungodly high-pitched growl cuts across the void. 
Deadpool and Wolvie, on high alert, turn towards the threat.
Cresting the hill, bathed in slow motion and silhouetted, 
bounds an animal. Smallish, maybe 10 to 20 pounds.
What comes into view is unexpected in every way. It’s a dog. 
Wearing a Deadpool suit. But not just any dog:
The UGLIEST MOTHER-FUCKING DOG ON THE PLANET. 
DOGPOOL!
Slow motion. Cue: Chris De Burgh’s song, “LADY IN RED”. 
Close on Dogpool, tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. 
One of its eyes is milky white while the other wanders in no 
particular direction. What little fur it possesses sprouts 
disdainfully from its weird head. 
Needless to say, Deadpool is SMITTEN instantly. Deadpool 
(also slow motion) drops to his knees, RIPS OFF HIS MASK. He 
extends his arms. Sincere musical swells are fucking 
everywhere. The dog continues charging towards Wade and leaps 
into his arms. She bathes Wade’s face in a hideous cocktail 
of saliva from a cankerous tongue. The music climaxes as 
DOGPOOL and Wade kiss in ecstasy. We hard cut out to:
WADE
Oh my heavens! Look at you. She’s 
coming with us.
WOLVERINE
No, she’s not.

WOLVERINE
Fuck no.
WADE
Oh yes--
Just then a voice is heard from just over the hill.
NICEPOOL (O.S.)
Sorry! Sorry ‘bout that! Come here, 
girl.
Wade and Wolverine watch as a man crests the hill. He’s 
immaculate. He wears a Deadpool suit with no mask. The suit 
looks like Yves Saint Laurent himself slummed it and designed 
a Marvel film. The man’s about twenty-percent more muscular 
and after a pretty healthy session in Lola, looks like a 
younger RYAN REYNOLDS in his prime before his looks were 
ravaged by four children and ten side hustles. The man’s a 
goddamn angel. 
WADE
Who are you?
NICEPOOL
I’m Deadpool. And I guess you’re 
Deadpool too? There’s a few of us. 
But in here, everybody calls me 
Nicepool. Or Wendy. Oh my goodness, 
wait ‘til you see LadyPool! She is 
gorgeous. She just had a baby too, 
and you can’t even tell.
WADE
I don’t think you’re supposed to 
say that.
NICEPOOL
That’s okay. I identify as a 
feminist.
WADE
Right.

You look like a Lamborghini.

calibre Desert Eagle pistoleros?
NICEPOOL
Of course. To match my ear huggie.
WADE
Can I have them?
NICEPOOL
Ha! Over my dead body. You’re fun. 
And I guess you’ve already met Mary 
Puppins. AKA: Dogpool. Careful 
where you put your hand, she’s 
ninety percent g-spot, and she’ll 
let you know it. You let this 
little flirt out of your sight for 
one second and she starts shopping 
for a new papa.
Dogpool rests comfortably in Wade’s arms. While Wade 
converses, the dog intermittently licks the inside of his 
mouth. It’s both horrifying and vaguely intimate. Everyone is 
uncomfortable. Especially the actor playing Wade. 
WADE
If you can’t be a responsible pet 
owner, then maybe you don’t deserve 
this little unicorn. 
NICEPOOL
Guilty! On all charges, your honor!
(prayer hands)
It shan’t happen again. 
WADE
Why are you so nice? 
NICEPOOL
It costs nothing to be kind. 
WOLVERINE

Shutting the fuck up is also free.

shirtless but he’s let himself go

NICEPOOL
(re: his face)
Come on, guys.
WADE
Oh, this guy. We’re looking for a 
group of survivors.

Oh. Yeah. There’s a bunch of us. 
Offshoots, Variants, castaways. The

WOLVERINE
We need to find this group hiding

Deadpool (mask now back on) draws the hardline:
DEADPOOL
No. No, no, no. Absolutely not. Put *
the tarp back on. *
WOLVERINE
Just get in the car.
DEADPOOL
This isn’t a car. This is a Honda 
fucking Odyssey. Throttle response

Music Cue: Avril Lavigne’s cover of “I’M WITH YOU”.
Sexy glamour shots of the Honda Odyssey. Camera tracks from 
the wheels, around the grill, and rakes across Wolverine in 
the driver’s seat with Deadpool riding shotgun. Deadpool’s 
head is out the window feeling the wind - like Lemon in *
“Logan”. 
Deadpool is playing around in the car, shooting fake webs 
from his hands. 
WOLVERINE

Wolverine turns off the radio.
DEADPOOL

We’re back inside the car. Shock. A passenger side airbag
deploys beside Deadpool’s head, firing him face-down into 
Wolvie’s crotch. 
Wolverine grabs his head and pulls him upright: 
WOLVERINE
Whaddya mean, “if”?
DEADPOOL

Wolverine. It’s the photo from his birthday party cake, a
picture of all his Fox-world friends. He’s kept it.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
This. This is why. Right here.
Because if we don't do something,
they die. I don't know anything
about saving worlds. Why would I
even care because MY entire world
is right here in this picture. It’s
only nine people and I have no idea
how to save it alone. I know how to
fuck people up for money. But you.
YOU know how to save ‘em. At least
the other Wolverine did. I guess
I’m stuck with the worst one.

Did you say you made an EDUCATED.
FUCKING. WISH?!
DEADPOOL
They call me the Merc With The
Mouth. They don’t call me,
“Truthful Timmy, the blowjob queen

Wolvie stares at Deadpool. Pulls his claw out of Deadpool’s
thigh and raises his fist. Scary. The words barely find their
way through his rage and gritted teeth.
WOLVERINE
One more word. Please, give me one.
DEADPOOL

Gubernatorial.
Wolverine almost lunges at Deadpool. Almost. But he stops.
Suddenly revels in the chance to be even more hurtful.
WOLVERINE
You know what? You are a fucking

An achingly long beat. Then:

Deadpool produces his KNIFE and goes to work on Wolverine,

Wolvie breaks Deadpool’s arm.

Deadpool retrieves his knife and goes back to work.

ELEVEN
People like us don’t go quietly. 
TVA knows that, so they took us 
out.
DEADPOOL
The answer is yes. I’m in.
BILLY
In what? 
DEADPOOL
A team. Me, you, you, and me. All 
of us together. Let’s get the fuck 
outta this place. 
WOLVERINE
Don’t listen to him, he’s a fucking 
liar.
DEADPOOL

IT WAS AN EDUCATED WISH!

Look, we’ve been inside Cassandra’s

Ugh that’s so sad. Wherever this

No, no, no. We don’t know that. He

fucking decimate their foes.
Lemon LEAPS from the blood-stained ground UP TO THE FACE OF 
THE GIANT SKULL, which she proceeds to run at an impossibly 
fast speed, her claws and foot-claws like crampons, as she 
scales the face of the giant skeleton towards the eye socket.
Just as Lemon reaches the eye socket she is YANKED OFF the 
face of the skull by PSYLOCKE’S WHIP!
Down on the ground below, Psylocke YANKS HARD, pulling Lemon 
off the skeletal face.
WITH LEMON IN SLO-MO: 
WITH PSYLOCKE’S WHIP WRAPPED AROUND HER WAIST, Lemon flings

You can’t go back there. To that *
judgement.
WOLVERINE *
Just once I want to be the man that *
Charles thought I was. *
CASSANDRA NOVA *
Logan. In the void, you can be what *
you are.
WOLVERINE
I just wanna be free.
CASSANDRA NOVA
I can set you free. I can silence 
all those voices... *
The voices fall silent. Wolverine looks relieved. 
CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
I’ve got you. 
(strokes his head)
I’ve got you. *
Wolverine looks up.
WOLVERINE
No.
(the tiniest twinkle in 
his eye)
I got you.
Cassandra doesn’t understand. Suddenly, the sky darkens and 
she looks up. It’s as if someone is putting a lid on the sky.

Can’t do that. You made Mr. 
Stabbins angry. You’re going to 
send us home, or I’m going to twist 
your fucking head off-- why are you 
laughing?
Indeed, Cassandra has started laughing.
CASSANDRA NOVA
I can’t send you home unless you 
get this thing off my head. And as 
soon as you do that, I’m going to 
boil your brains on an atomic level 
whilst flicking my bean to the Enya *

DEADPOOL
There’s an Enya box set?
Wolverine and Deadpool shoot each other a look. Shit.

Oh. You have no idea what it’s

WOLVERINE
Not everyone gets a speech.

Okay, if I take this helmet off. Do

Wolverine gets serious. 
WOLVERINE
TAKE IT OFF. I’m wearing the suit, 
and that means a lot of things, but 
most of all it means I’m an X-Man. 
I am the X-Man. And I know your 
brother. As much as I want to 
fucking kill you with every bone in

you. He would not let me stand here

Take your hands off.
Cassandra is shocked...because she felt that. 
WOLVERINE (CONT’D)
This is for Charles. 
Wolverine removes the JUGGERNAUT HELMET. 
Cassandra’s wounds instantly SNAP shut. Cassandra lifts her

CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
An amateur magician rolled through 
here awhile back. I killed him of

trinket on his lovely fingers.
DEADPOOL

Cassandra gestures out the eye socket, creating a glowing 
circle in the air outside.
DEADPOOL (CONT’D)
(breathless)
Oh. Marvel sparkle circle.
WOLVERINE
What is that?
CASSANDRA NOVA
This is your way home. I do owe you 
for saving my life.
She makes a sound, like a master calling their pet. The 
ground trembles and the sky darkens as ALIOTH appears on the 
horizon, SPEEDING TOWARDS Cassandra’s compound.
Cassandra steps down from the edge of the eye socket, turns 
to Deadpool and Wolverine. 
CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
But let’s keep things interesting. 
I’d say you have about four seconds

Alioth closes fast, almost to the skull now. Deadpool and 
Wolverine LEAP towards the socket, just as Alioth arrives. 
This is the end. Down below, our forgotten heroes battle on, 
relentless. 
In profile we see our heroes LEAP OUT from the skull at he 
same instant that Alioth meets them, the Marvel Sparkle 
Circle between them in the air. 
As Alioth hurtles through, the air finally clears, REVEALING 
NOTHING BUT THE CIRCLE LEFT BEHIND. Whether Deadpool and 
Wolverine lived or died, we don’t yet know.

PETER
I’m glad you gave us a second

half the commission. 
CRASH! Wolverine and Deadpool crash down from the sky into 
the roof of the CARNIVAL. A beat. Peter holds the keys, his 
smile frozen. 
DEADPOOL
Ow, that feels like a Kia. It’s a

ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD
HOLY SHIT! That’s Deadpool.

Deadpool pops up quickly.

A guy named Paradox. He said he’d *

MR. PARADOX
No! Stop! Piss off! You’re too

You’re fucking done.

MR. PARADOX
How dare you? No one comes back

Paradox goes pale. The GROUND SHAKES. ENERGY CRACKLES in the

Oh no, we’re on it. We’re gonna *
head down and dismantle that thing

Cassandra flicks her fingers, sending Deadpool and Wolverine 
FLYING DOWN THE ENTIRE STREET. They slam into CARS along the 
way, before CRASHING right through a STOREFRONT at the end of 
the block. 
BACK WITH CASSANDRA, who continues to probe Paradox’s brain.
CASSANDRA NOVA (CONT’D)
You know the funny thing is I was *

98 EXT. DOWN STREET FROM TVA OUTPOST - DAY 98
“Like a Prayer” spins up as Deadpool and Wolverine hack their 
way through an ARMY OF DEADPOOLS in a spectacular ONER. 
We RAMP in and out of SLO-MO. BLOOD sprays. TEETH fly. 
SUPLEXES. JUDO TOSSES. AGGRESSIVE LEAPS from variant to 
variant, like flesh stepping-stones.
It’s fucking glorious.
Deadpool and Wolverine continue hacking their way through the 
DEADPOOL ARMY. An orgy of superhero-ness. *
99 I/E. WADE’S APARTMENT WINDOW - DAY 99*
The camera tilts up to find BLIND AL at her window. *
BLIND AL *
Motherfucker. I wish I were deaf. *
100 EXT. DOWN STREET FROM TVA OUTPOST - DAY 100
A symphony of VIOLENCE as DEADPOOL and WOLVERINE take on 
combatants from ALL SIDES, Deadpool dodging assailants that 
Wolverine finishes off and vice/versa. The heroes mow through 
the Deadpool Corps and approach the TVA outpost, eventually 
our duo finishes off the last of the Deadpool Corps. 
Finally, KIDPOOL WHIPS HEADPOOL at Deadpool. Headpool screams 
a VIKING WAR CRY...and is skewered by a KATANA.

Come on. We don’t have time for *

PETERPOOL (O.S.) *

PETERPOOL (Peter STUFFED into the old red DEADPOOL COSTUME *

Stunned, Peter removes his mask. The crowd goes WILD! He *

Deadpool and Wolverine disappear into the TVA outpost. *
105 INT. TVA OUTPOST - CONTROL ROOM - DAY 105*
Deadpool and Wolverine race into the control room. Mr.
Paradox looks back from his control panel.
MR. PARADOX
Oh, now you’re here. Oh well you’re

WOLVERINE
Not yet it’s not.
DEADPOOL

No, no, no. But we’re very close.

MR. PARADOX
If she steals the Time Ripper’s 
energy she has the power to shred *
the fabric of all realities until 
there’s nothing left but the Void.
WOLVERINE
How do we shut it down?
MR. PARADOX 
I-I don’t know...
Wolverine pops his claws but leaves the middle blade 
retracted, so he can pin Mr. Paradox’s head to the console, 
one claw on each side of Mr. Paradox’s neck. 
WOLVERINE
How about now?
DEADPOOL
The mask is really intimidating, 
huh? Not stupid like Batman.
MR. PARADOX
L-look...
Mr. Paradox brings up THE VIDEO FEED OF THE TIME RIPPER’S 
REACTOR POWER SOURCE, deep in the outpost’s bowels. 
Two MASSIVE PLASMA PIPES rise up from the floor, snake around 
each other (while never coming closer than 10 ft to one 
another) and exit through the ceiling. One PIPE crackles with 
ORANGE energy. The other’s is a DEEP BLUE. *
MR. PARADOX (CONT’D)
The Ripper is fed from a secured 
chamber below ground. It is powered *
by twin matter and anti-matter *
feeds converging inside the device. *
Now Cassandra Nova is redirecting *
the Ripper’s power to eliminate 
timelines, all of them. No timeline *
will be safe from extinction. Now 
theoretically you could stop her by *
short circuiting the feeds in the *
chamber below. If one of you were *
to create a circuit between the two *
feeds, then the released power *
would destroy the machine, but... *
DEADPOOL
Come on, man! If you’re not gonna 
swallow SPIT IT OUT.

Yeah, I could live with that too 
actually. We survive anything. 
We’re like cockroaches.
MR. PARADOX
Not this time. This is matter and *
anti-matter. They do not play 
nicely with each other. When they 
mix in your body you will be 
atomized. Trust the laws of physics 
if you don’t trust me. Even if you *
lived long enough to make the *
circuit you will die down there. *
Deadpool and Wolverine stare at the screen, watching 
Cassandra feed the Time Ripper.
106 INT. LOWER TVA OUTPOST - SUBWAY TRACKS - DAY 106
Deadpool and Wolverine march along the SUBWAY TRACKS leading 
toward the REACTOR POWER SOURCE. 
107 INT. TVA OUTPOST - POWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS 107
They approach a massive BLAST DOOR at the end of the tunnel 
leading into the POWER ROOM. Wolverine stops Deadpool before 
they enter.
WOLVERINE
Hold up, hold up. You heard that *
asshole upstairs. Even if we pull 
this off, we’re dead. Permanently.
DEADPOOL
That’s why it’s gotta be me. 
WOLVERINE

Wolverine is stunned. Deadpool takes a breath. Removes his 
mask.
WADE

You made an educated wish.
Wade can’t help but smile through the emotion. Lotta road 
traveled here. Wolverine pulls out the crumpled picture from 
Wade’s birthday. He kept it. 
WOLVERINE (CONT’D)
Come on. You’ve got a whole world 
to go back to. I got nothin’. I got 
nothin’. Give me this. 
Wade is speechless with gratitude. Staring at the photo. We 
see the faces of Wade’s family. His friends. Vanessa. His 
world. Wolverine pushes the photo into Wade’s chest, before 
he turns and walks towards the power room.
WADE
Hey!
Wolverine stops in the threshold, looks back. 
WADE (CONT’D)
I waited a long time for this teamup.
(beat)
And ya know something? You were the 
best Wolverine.
WOLVERINE
Say hi to your friends for me.
Wolverine meets Wade’s gaze. A small nod of acknowledgment. 
Hard to read his feelings with his mask on, but his voice 
tells a different story.
Deadpool MASKS UP. 
Wolverine smiles almost imperceptibly. Nods. Steps inside the 
blast door, turns to close it when WHAM!! He’s clocked right 
in the skull by a fire extinguisher wielded by Deadpool. 
Wolvie reels and recovers, but it’s too late: 
SLAM! 
Deadpool shoves Wolverine aside, slams the door shut and 
SPINS the LOCKING WHEEL INSIDE. Wolverine pounds on the door, 
yells at Deadpool through the window in the blast door.

Deadpool steps away. Wolverine puts dents in the steel door 
with his fists. But it’s too thick. Steps back and with a 
running start, lowers his shoulder and bashes into the door, 
testing the limits of his strength and the door’s hinges. 
108 INT. LOWER TVA - SUBTERRANEAN POWER ROOM - DAY 108
Deadpool stands in front of the snaking tubes pumping PLASMA 
and ANTI-PLASMA to the Time Ripper high above. 
He takes it all in. The powers at play are truly awesome.
DEADPOOL
Fuck it. Time to save the world.
Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” reprises. Deadpool grabs the PLASMA 
TUBE. The energy snakes up his arm, wracking his body with 
pain. 
With a truly super human effort he stretches his hand closer 
to the ANTI-PLASMA tube to complete the circuit. Wolverine 
rams the door futilely.

Mr. Paradox watches.
MR. PARADOX
He’s not going to make it. It’s

Back on Deadpool. He stretches his fingers, so hard they look 
like they’ll pop out of their sockets. NOT EVEN CLOSE. Still 
he keeps Reaching. Reaching...Reaching...
Suddenly a hand grabs hold of Deadpool’s forearm
WOLVERINE MADE IT INSIDE. Wolverine came for him. 
They lock eyes. Wolverine NODS. 
Like a Prayer turns orchestral. Epic. Wolverine’s arms 
stretch wide. Two saviors. Side by side...

That is, until Wolverine POPS HIS CLAWS. They extend...and...

Cassandra is mid-rapture. The GROUND begins to shake. 
She looks worried, then concentrates...absorbing more power. 
INTERCUT with DEADPOOL and WOLVERINE below her. 
Reality seems to VIBRATE around them. 
The powerful forces at play test the integrity of Deadpool’s 
TVA-issued suit, while WOLVERINE’S MASK gets partially ripped 
away, then his chest armor is BLOWN RIGHT OFF, revealing 
insanely cut ABS. Even wracked with energy, Deadpool manages 
to ogle him.
The energy feeding Cassandra changes...she screams in pain. 
The TIME RIPPER atomizes, OBLITERATING CASSANDRA NOVA.
And presumably our HEROES.

Wade and Vanessa lock eyes. The chasm between them, perhaps a 
little closer now. A flicker of hope. He continues looking at 
her as Dogpool’s tongue explores the inside of Wade’s mouth. 
As the camera pans across everyone’s faces, we see the 
relaxed joy among these pals. 
WADE (V.O.)
Everyone wants to matter. Turns out 
ya don’t need to be Marvel Jesus to 
do it. You just need to open your 
eyes and look around. And if you’re 
lucky? You’ll find a few friends. 
Old friends...
We finally drift to a stop at an unexpected face... LEMON. 
WADE (V.O.)
...And new. 
115 INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY 115
Close on B-15.
WADE (V.O.)
Including some in pretty high 
places. 
She looks happy. Perhaps... smitten. She leans in and 
kisses... PETER.

We see we’re at the door of an apartment. Peter looks 
obscenely happy.
PETER
Thanks for your help with that *
Lemon thing. *
B-15 *
We don’t speak of that. *
They kiss. *
A time door opens behind her. With an effortless cool, she 
steps back in and DISAPPEARS.

117 INT. WADE’S APARTMENT - LATER 117
From across the room, we see Wade and friends laughing, 
drinking, enjoying their time together deep into the night. 
Logan catches Wade staring at Vanessa.
LOGAN
Give me the fucking dog. Talk to 
the girl.
Wade turns to Vanessa.
VANESSA
Oh hi.
WADE
Hi.
VANESSA
You’ve been busy.
WADE
I did it for you. Even if you don’t 
want me. I did it for you.
WADE (V.O.)
Turns out I am the world saving 
type. Just look around this table 
if you want proof. And the best 
part? Sometimes the people we save?
Camera slides slowly as we RACK FOCUS to the foreground where 
we REVEAL:

The two legendary masks. Deadpool and Wolverine. Battered-toshit and worse for wear, but intact. Sitting on the counter
casually, but no less iconic.
WADE (V.O.)
They save us right back.

Then:
118 INT. TVA - COMMAND CENTER - DAY 118
Deadpool is watching the bank of monitors in the TVA Control
Room. He’s focussed on one specific camera: The PRISON TRUCK
with Jonathan, Deadpool, and Wolverine.
It’s the footage from the CCTV camera inside the spherical
prison cell. It’s grainy, but we can clearly see and hear
Jonathan.
DEADPOOL
(to camera)
I’m tired of these absolutely vile
rumors that I got Johnny killed.
Let’s look at the tape.
JONATHAN *
In the void, you’re either food for *
Alioth...or you work for Her.
DEADPOOL
Go on, Jonathan.
JONATHAN
And I’ll tell you who “her” is...
Cassandra Nova. A megalomaniacal
psychotic asshole. A finger-lickin’
dead-inside Pixie slab of third
rate dime-store nut-milk and I’ll
tell you what she can do...
DEADPOOL
I’m listening...
JONATHAN
She can lick my goddamn cinnamon
ring clean and kick rocks all the
way to bald hell. In fact, I don’t
give a shit if she removes all of
my skin and pops me like some
nightmarish blood balloon.

 2ND BLUE REV. (04/17/24) 138.
If the last thing I do in this god- *
forsaken cum-gutter of an existence 
is light that fuck-fox on fire, I 
still won’t die happy. 
DEADPOOL
Holy shit, girl. You crazy. 
JONATHAN
That’s right, Wade. I won’t be 
happy til I’ve urinated on her 
freshly barbecued corpse and huskfucked the charred remains while 
gargling Juggernaut’s Jugger-nuts. 
DEADPOOL
Wow.
JONATHAN
And you can quote me.
DEADPOOL
‘Kay. 
Deadpool turns back to camera.

Got you, fuck face.
